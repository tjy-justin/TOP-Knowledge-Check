# 7.2 Using Git in the Real World

## Knowledge Check

- [What name is typically given for a Git remote that points to a repo that’s been forked?](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-using-git-in-the-real-world#initial-setup)
- [Can you directly send your changes to a repository that you don’t own/have write access to?](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-using-git-in-the-real-world#send-changes)
- [What should you do immediately before merging your feature branch into main?](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-using-git-in-the-real-world#ongoing-workflow)

1. It’s called `origin`.
2. No, you’ll need to make a pull request.
3. Do `git pull upstream/main` to fetch as well as merge `upstream`‘s code into your main branch. Then, `git merge main` to your feature branch. This ensures there are no conflicts between the latest version of the `upstream` repo as well as your code changes. If there are none, feel free to merge into main.
