1. `git commit --amend`
2. We can use `git commit --amend` to change the last commit, `git rebase -i` to change multiple commit messages, reorder, squash, split, or delete them.
3. `git push --force-with-lease` which checks if the local copy you’re working with has an outdated branch you tried to push to.
4. These commands can destroy work your coworkers have created.
5. 1. If working on a team project, make sure rewriting history is safe to do and others know you’re doing it.
	2. Ideally, stick to using these commands only on branches that you’re working with by yourself.
	3. Using the `-f` flag to force something should scare you, and you better have a really good reason for using it.
	4. Don’t push after every single commit, changing published history should be avoided when possible.
6. Git branches act as movable pointers to one of your commits, where each of its commits also store a pointer to the one before it.
