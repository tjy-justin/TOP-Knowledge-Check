# 2.1 Objects and Object Constructors

## Knowledge Check

- [Write an object constructor and instantiate the object.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-objects-and-object-constructors#object-constructors)
- [Describe what a prototype is and how it can be used.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-objects-and-object-constructors#the-prototype)
- [Explain prototypal inheritance.](https://javascript.info/prototype-inheritance)
- [Understand the basic do’s and don’t’s of prototypical inheritance.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-objects-and-object-constructors#recommended-method-for-prototypal-inheritance)
- [Explain what `Object.create` does](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create)
- [How does `this` behave in different situations?](https://dmitripavlutin.com/gentle-explanation-of-this-in-javascript/)

1. Answer:
	```js
	function book(title, author, pages, status) {
		this.title = title;
		this.author = author;
		this.pages = pages;
		this.status = status;
	}
	
	book.prototype.bookInfo = function () {
		return `${this.title} by ${this.author}, ${this.pages} pages, ${this.status}.`;
	};
	
	let theHobbit = new book("The Hobbit", "J.R.R. Tolkien", "295", "unread");
	console.log(theHobbit.bookInfo());
	```
2. Each objects have a prototype. Prototypes are property of said objects that references another object. As for use cases, we can define functions on the `prototype` of that object, like we did in the 1st answer. This makes prototypal inheritance happen.
3. Prototypal inheritance allows objects to inherit its prototypal objects’ methods and properties. When we read a property from `object`, and it’s missing, JavaScript automatically takes it from the prototype.
4. It’s recommend to use `Object.create()` for prototypal inheritance. If we just use an assignment operator, like `EighthGrader.prototype = Student.prototype`, it prevents us from making actual copies.
5. The `Object.create()` method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.
6. In JS, `this` changes based on context (the value of `this`) and the function invocation types.

   In particular, we should pay attention to our thought process of `this` in functions. Rather than asking, “Where is `this` taken from?”, ask, “How is the*`function invoked*?”.

   As for arrow functions, we can ask, “What is `this` inside the outer function where the arrow function is _defined_”?

## Prototypal Inheritance Tasks

1. `true`, `null`, `undefined`. The third output indicates the property is nonexistent.
2. [Prototypal Inheritance Task 2](https://codepen.io/raineedust/pen/QWmbdBG)
3. The rabbit. This is because `this` is an object before the dot, so `rabbit.eat()` modifies `rabbit`.
