1. False links between objects and the functions might be created.
2. Answer:
	```js
	const personFactory = (name, age) => {
		const sayHello = () => console.log('hello!');
		return { name, age, sayHello };
	};
	
	const jeff = personFactory('jeff', 27);
	
	console.log(jeff.name); // 'jeff'
	
	jeff.sayHello(); // calls the function and logs 'hello!'
	```
3. By default, anything in JS are globally scoped, but once they live in functions, they become locally scoped and unable to be accessed normally by anything outside. In ES6 new keywords `let` and `const` was added.
4. Closure allows functions retain their scope even if they are passed around and called outside of that scope. They are useful for creating private, non-globally-scoped variables and functions.
5. Private functions are useful to split the functions into a modular form, allowing clean and readable code.
6. Answer:
	```js
	const Person = (name) => {
		const sayName = () => console.log(`my name is ${name}`);
		return {sayName};
	}
	
	const Nerd = (name) => {
		// simply create a person and pull out the sayName function with destructuring assignment syntax!
		const {sayName} = Person(name);
		const doSomethingNerdy = () => console.log('nerd stuff');
		return {sayName, doSomethingNerdy};
	}
	
	const jeff = Nerd('jeff');
	
	jeff.sayName(); //my name is jeff
	jeff.doSomethingNerdy(); // nerd stuff
	```
7. Modules are essentially factory functions, but wrapped in an IIFE.
8. IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression. The primary reason to use it is data privacy. Variables declared within an IIFE is inaccessible to the outside.
9. Namespacing is a programming paradigm that involves providing scope to identifiers (e.g. variables, functions). This allows identifiers with the same names to be invoked in different contexts without conflicts, such as `car.startEngine()`, `bike.startEngine()`.
